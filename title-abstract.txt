Title:
E4E MicroFaune Project

Abstract:
Nowadays, human activities such as wildfires and hunting have become the largest factor that would have serious negative effects on biodiversity. In order to deeply understand how anthropogenic activities deeply affect wildlife populations, field biologists utilize automated image classification driven by neural networks to get relevant biodiversity information from the images. However, for some small animals such as insects or birds, the camera could not work very well because of the small size of these animals. It is extremely hard for cameras to capture the movement and activities of small animals. To effectively solve this problem, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become one of the most popular methods. We could utilize sounds we collect from PAM to train certain machine learning models which could tell us the fluctuation of biodiversity of all these small animals. The goal of the whole program is to test the biodiversity of these small animals (most of them are birds). However, the whole program could be divided into plenty of small parts. I and Jinsong will pay attention to the intermediate step of the program.

The goal of our project is to generate subsets of audio recordings that have higher probability of vocalization of interest, which could help our labeling volunteer to save time and energy. The solutions could help us reduce down the amount of time and resources required to achieve enough training data for species-level classifiers. We perform the same thing with AID_NeurIPS_2021. Only the data is different between these two github. For this github, we use the peru data instead of Coastal_Reserve data.
